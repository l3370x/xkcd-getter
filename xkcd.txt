268	Choices: Part 5	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/choices_part_5.png	I wonder what percentage of not-obviously-busy people on the street would say yes to kite-flying with a stranger.  This looks like a job for Science!
269	TCMP	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tcmp.png	A big obstacle in experimenting with the mind's dream-simulation-engine is holding onto the details as you wake up.  With TCMP you can bring back any information you want.

271	Powers of One	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/powers_of_one.png	It's kinda Zen when you think about it, if you don't think too hard.

277	Long Light	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/long_light.png	You can look at practically any part of anything manmade around you and think 'some engineer was frustrated while designing this.'  It's a little human connection.

279	Pickup Lines	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pickup_lines.png	That shirt looks good on you, but it would look even better stuffed into the neck of a vodka bottle and flung burning through our office building's window.  Let's fucking do it and never look back.

332	Gyroscopes	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/gyroscopes.png	We didn't actually land on the moon -- it just looked like we did because of precession.  Also, gyroscopes caused 9/11.

518	Flow Charts	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/flow_charts.png	At 8 drinks, you switch the torrent from FreeBSD to Microsoft Bob.  C'mon, it'll be fun!
519	11th Grade	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/11th_grade.png	And the ten minutes striking up a conversation with that strange kid in homeroom sometimes matters more than every other part of high school combined.
520	Cuttlefish	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cuttlefish.png	Unless the CS students finish the robot revolution before you finish the cephalopod one.
521	2008 Christmas Special	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/2008_christmas_special.png	'How could you possibly think typing 'import skynet' was a good idea?'
522	Google Trends	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/google_trends.png	Obama has been writing Lincoln/Obama erotic fan fiction on his secret livejournal.  Excerpt:  Lincoln lay back on the bed, nude save for his trademark stovepipe hat.  'Tell me,' he purred seductively, as he and Obama formed a more perfect union. 'When you come, is it 10% ethanol?'
523	Decline	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/decline.png	'There's also a spike on the Fourier transform at the one-month mark where --' 'You want to stop talking right now.'
524	Party	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/party.png	I wonder what 2008 meme will go bizarrely mainstream in 2009 like Rickrolling did 2007-2008.  I Accidentally <noun>?  Yo dawg?  Place your bets now!
525	I Know You're Listening	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/i_know_youre_listening.png	It's basically Pascal's Wager for the paranoid prankster.
526	Converting to Metric	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/converting_to_metric.png	According to River, 'adequate' vacuuming systems drain the human body at about half a liter per second.
527	Keynote	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/keynote.png	He should be better soon -- now that the Apple Store is getting rid of DRM, Cory Doctorow will get rid of his Steve Jobs voodoo doll.
528	Windows 7	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/windows_7.png	Disclaimer: I have not actually tried the beta yet.  I hear it's quite pleasant and hardly Hitler-y at all.
529	Sledding Discussion	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sledding_discussion.png	If you get your hands on that one, it's the worst place to have a breaking-up conversation.
530	I'm An Idiot	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/im_an_idiot.png	Sadly, this is a true story.  At least I learned about the OS X 'say' command.
531	Contingency Plan	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/contingency_plan.png	Kids are genetic experiments.  We're just experimenting responsibly!
532	Piano	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/piano.png	Good thing he didn't make it smaller, or it'd need someone three inches tall to play it.
533	Laptop Hell	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/laptop_hell.png	The xkcd.com sysadmin has a Q2010, and I can attest that it can handle a fall down several flight of concrete steps.  Relatedly, he's upset with me -- I hope he doesn't take revenge by messing with my site's contenDISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS
534	Genetic Algorithms	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/genetic_algorithms.png	Just make sure you don't have it maximize instead of minimize.
535	It Might Be Cool	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/it_might_be_cool.png	'And ovaries.  Man, ovaries, huh?'  [awkward pause]  '... faithfully.'
536	Space Elevators	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/space_elevators.png	If you think space elevators are good, but just too boring and practical, check out the 'space fountain'.
537	Ducklings	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ducklings.png	DUCKLOOP'D?
538	Security	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png	Actual actual reality: nobody cares about his secrets.  (Also, I would be hard-pressed to find that wrench for $5.)
539	Boyfriend	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/boyfriend.png	... okay, but because you said that, we're breaking up.
540	Base System	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/base_system.png	I once got to second base with a basketball player.  She was so confused.
541	TED Talk	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ted_talk.png	The IAU ban came after the 'redefinition of 'planet' to include the IAU president's mom' incident.
542	Cover-Up	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cover_up.png	Man, this trick has saved me so many times.
543	Sierpinski Valentine	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sierpinski_valentine.png	Especially you mouseover-text readers.  You're the best.  <3
544	Pep Talk	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pep_talk.png	Listen!  They said a team of chess players coached by someone with no understanding of basketball would never be competitive in the NBA!  Well, it turns out they're pretty perceptive.
545	Neutrality Schmeutrality	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/neutrality_shmeutrality.png	'Hey, everyone, you can totally trust that I didn't do a word count on MY edit!'
546	Music DRM	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/music_drm.png	Just yesterday I bought my first non-DRM'd songs (The Last Vegas, in keeping with my 'I only listen to things from Guitar Hero' theme).
547	Simple	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/simple.png	Actually, I think if all higher math professors had to write for the Simple English Wikipedia for a year, we'd be in much better shape academically.
548	Kindle	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/kindle.png	I'm happy with my Kindle 2 so far, but if they cut off the free Wikipedia browsing, I plan to show up drunk on Jeff Bezos's lawn and refuse to leave.
549	Westley's a Dick	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/westleys_a_dick.png	Inigo/Buttercup 4eva <3
550	Density	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/density.png	If only I had asked 4chan for ideas for what I should do to prevent this!
551	Etch-a-Sketch	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/etch-a-sketch.png	Surrounded by boring mysteries.
552	Correlation	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png	Correlation doesn't imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there'.
553	Pirate Bay	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pirate_bay.png	We find you guilty of closing your torrents as soon as they finish.  Your sentence is unremovable Hungarian subtitles on everything.
554	Not Enough Work	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/not_enough_work.png	It's even harder if you're an asshole who pronounces <> brackets.
555	Two Mirrors	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/two_mirrors.png	If you actually do this, what really happens is Douglas Hofstadter appears and talks to you for eight hours about strange loops.
556	Alternative Energy Revolution	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/alternative_energy_revolution.jpg	The moment their arms spun freely in our air, they were doomed -- for Man has earned his right to hold this planet against all comers, by virtue of occasionally producing someone totally batshit insane.
557	Students	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/students.png	The same goes for the one where you're wrestling the Green Ranger in the swimming pool full of Crisco.  You guys all have that dream, right?  It's not just me.  Right?
558	1000 Times	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/1000_times.png	And 0.002 dollars will NEVER equal 0.002 cents.
559	No Pun Intended	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/no_pun_intended.png	Like spelling 'dammit' correctly -- with two m's -- it's a troll that works best on the most literate.
560	Lithium Batteries	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lithium_batteries.png	I'm normally a pretty frugal person, but I still compulsively buy any R/C aircraft that's less than $30.  In the last few years, this has become a problem.
561	Well	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/well.png	I'll concede ergonomics anecdotally, but none of the studies of Dvorak were at all rigorous (the most-cited Navy study was overseen by Dvorak himself).  And the 'slow typists down' thing is a myth.  Also EMACS RULES VI DROOLS WOOOOOOO!
562	Parking	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/parking.png	Police reported three dozen cheerful bystanders, yet no one claims to have seen who did it.
563	Fermirotica	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fermirotica.png	I love how Google handles dimensional analysis.  Stats are ballpark and vary wildly by time of day and whether your mom is in town.
564	Crossbows	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/crossbows.png	I hate being the slowest guy in the lab.
565	Security Question	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security_question.png	Let's invite him to a party and play 'I never'.  Okay, I never hid any bodies SOUTH of Main Street. ... he's taking a drink!
566	Matrix Revisited	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/matrix_revisited.png	I actually remember being entertained by both the sequels while in the theater.  They just don't hold up nearly as well in later comparison.
567	Urgent Mission	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/urgent_mission.png	Sure, we could stop dictators and pandemics, but we could also make the signs on every damn diagram make sense.
568	Well 2	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/well_2.png	But I've made $13.72 already today!  Ow, stop throwing pennies.
569	Borders	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/borders.png	Eventually a UN is set up.  And then a lone rebel runs down the line of flags in front of it, runs back to his base, and gets a kajillion points.
570	New Car	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/new_car.png	Somewhere out there is a company that has actually figured out how to enlarge penises, and it's helpless to reach potential customers.
571	Can't Sleep	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cant_sleep.png	If androids someday DO dream of electric sheep, don't forget to declare sheepCount as a long int.
572	Together	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/together.png	This scavenger hunt is getting boring.  Let's go work on the treehouse!
573	Parental Trolling	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/parental_trolling.png	They'll pick music and culture that they know annoys you.  Building in behavioral easter eggs is a fair retaliation!
574	Swine Flu	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/swine_flu.png	Bad flu epidemics can hit young adults hardest because they provoke their powerful immune systems into overreaction, so to stay healthy spend the next few weeks drunk and sleep-deprived to keep yours suppressed.
575	Tag Combination	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tag_combination.png	I love Eileen / and want you to love her / When you're around / I'm one floor above her / If you could see / just how much I adore her / Oh, that pretty red dress / I'd do anything for her /  (Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ayy)
576	Packages	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/packages.png	Day six: 'The hell?  Who mails a bobcat?'
577	The Race: Part 1	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_race_part_1.png	Great, and you JUST finished paying off the settlement over the Wayne Coyne hamster ball incident.
578	The Race: Part 2	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_race_part_2.png	The Hammer + Captain Tightpants == Captain Hammerpants?
579	The Race: Part 3	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_race_part_3.png	No, the best things about The Sarah Connor Chronicles were: (1) watching Sarah and Cameron try to pass for normal, and (2) Cameron throwing people and things through walls.  Everything else was pretty secondary.
580	The Race: Part 4	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_race_part_4.png	Things are rarely just crazy enough to work, but they're frequently just crazy enough to fail hilariously.
581	The Race: Part 5	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_race_part_5.png	It was actually canceled because they just noticed he's been naked under that coat the whole time.  There's a petition on Facebook to get Fox to un-cancel it, and one on Livejournal to get him to take off the coat.
582	Brakes	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/brakes.png	It was the funniest 6.5 seconds of my life, although as usual like 80% of it was just Tom and Ray's gasping, hacking laughter.
583	CNR	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cnr.png	Can't and shouldn't.
584	Unsatisfied	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/unsatisfied.png	Forever comparing, never evaluating on any external scale.  If you were a sort function, you'd never break the nlogn barrier.
585	Outreach	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/outreach.png	Completely implausible? Yes. Nevertheless, worth keeping a can of shark repellent next to the bed.
586	Mission to Culture	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mission_to_culture.png	It can't be very MUCH money ... they apparently can't even afford a sampler.  I mean, with a little remixing, some of this could be kinda good!
587	Crime Scene	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/crime_scene.png	I think I see a Mandelbrot set! No, that's just blood splatters. Golly.
588	Pep Rally	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pep_rally.png	You know, pep rallies weirded me out in high school, and they've only gotten creepier in retrospect.
589	Designated Drivers	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/designated_drivers.png	Calling a cab means cutting into beer money.
590	Papyrus	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/papyrus.png	I secretly, deep in my guilty heart, like Papyrus and don't care if it's overused. [Cue hate mail in beautifully-kerned Helvetica.]
591	Troll Slayer	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/troll_slayer.png	We have met the enemy and he is us.
592	Drama	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/drama.png	This happens in geek circles every so often. The 'Hey, this is just a system I can figure out easily!' is also a problem among engineers first diving into the stock market.
593	Voynich Manuscript	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/voynich_manuscript.png	Wait, is that the ORIGINAL voynich manuscript?  Where did you GET that?  Wanna try playing a round of Druids and Dicotyledons?
594	Period	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/period.png	413 nanohertz, by the way.
595	Android Girlfriend	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/android_girlfriend.png	Programming the sexbots to enjoy sex seemed a sensible move at the time, but we didn't realize the consequences of their developing fetishes.
596	Latitude	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/latitude.png	The G1, especially with the new Android upgrade, is way better than I originally thought.
597	Addiction	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/addiction.png	But if you unplug everything, it gets so quiet you hear that high-pitched empty-room hum.  And then the whispers begin.
598	Porn	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/porn.png	I have a thing for corrupt women.
599	Apocalypse	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/apocalypse.png	I wonder if I still have time to go shoot a short film with Kevin Bacon.
600	Android Boyfriend	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/android_boyfriend.png	Which is, coincidentally, the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house.
601	Game Theory	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/game_theory.png	Wait, no, that one also loses. How about a nice game of chess?
602	Overstimulated	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/overstimulated.png	My favorite thing to do at parties is to talk judgementally about people who aren't there.
603	Idiocracy	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/idiocracy.png	People aren't going to change, for better or for worse. Technology's going to be so cool. All in all, the future will be okay! Except climate; we fucked that one up.
604	Qwertial Aphasia	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/qwertial_aphasia.png	If this were SMBC, the alt-text drawing thingy would be a giraffe hooker fluttering her eyelashes.
605	Extrapolating	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/extrapolating.png	By the third trimester, there will be hundreds of babies inside you.
606	Cutting Edge	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cutting_edge.png	I remember trying to log in to the original Command and Conquer servers a year or two back and feeling like I was knocking on the boarded-up gates of a ghost town. 
607	2038	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/2038.png	If only we'd chosen 1944-12-02 08:45:52 as the Unix epoch, we could've combined two doomsday scenarios into one and added a really boring scene to that Roland Emmerich movie.
608	Form	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/form.png	'This space intentionally left blank' is less immediately provocative but more Hofstadterially confusing.
609	Tab Explosion	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tab_explosion.png	Cracked.com is another inexplicable browser narcotic.  They could write a list of '17 worst haircuts in the Ottoman Empire' and I'd read through to the end, then click on all the links at the end.
610	Sheeple	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sheeple.png	Hey, what are the odds -- five Ayn Rand fans on the same train!  Must be going to a convention.
611	Disaster Voyeurism	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/disaster_voyeurism.png	Hurricane forums are full of excited comments about central pressure and wind speed and comparisons to Camille and 1931 and 1938, with hastily-tacked-on notes about how it will be tragic if anyone dies and they hope it's a dud.
612	Estimation	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/estimation.png	They could say "the connection is probably lost," but it's more fun to do naive time-averaging to give you hope that if you wait around for 1,163 hours, it will finally finish.
613	Threesome	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/threesome.png	I wanted us to try finding an approximate numeric solution, but noooo.
614	Woodpecker	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/woodpecker.png	If you don't have an extension cord I can get that too.  Because we're friends!  Right?
615	Avoidance	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/avoidance.png	Hobby: seeing how many menu selections you can get someone to go through before they realize you're not an automated system and/or hang up.
616	Lease	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lease.png	You should talk to the girl down the hall; I think you'd like her.  Lemme know if you find out why she's ordering all those colored plastic balls.
617	Understocked	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/understocked.png	My biology grad student friends tell me that different types of alcohol don't actually have different effects. I trust their expertise, not because of the 'biology' part, but because of the 'grad student'.
618	Asteroid	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/asteroid.png	My Deep Impact/Little Prince crossover fanfic has been poorly received by the community.
619	Supported Features	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/supported_features.png	I hear many of you finally have smooth Flash support, but me and my Intel card are still waiting on a kernel patch somewhere in the pipeline before we can watch Jon Stewart smoothly.
620	Wings	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wings.png	Please do not try any of this and die or get arrested.
621	Superlative	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/superlative.png	Stay while I recount the crazy TF2 kill I managed yesterday, my friends.
622	Haiku Proof	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/haiku_proof.png	After somewhere around 40 hours, there's no academic reason to go to the class. Only go for the hallucinations.
623	Oregon	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/oregon.png	A century later, the harrowing flight of the survivors from Oregon was dramatized in a popular video game.
624	Branding	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/branding.png	Actually, 'RSS&M' is kinda catchy.
625	Collections	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/collections.png	You know what really helps an existential crisis? Wondering how much shelf space to leave for a Terry Pratchett collection.
626	Newton and Leibniz	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/newton_and_leibniz.png	YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH!
627	Tech Support Cheat Sheet	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tech_support_cheat_sheet.png	'Hey Megan, it's your father. How do I print out a flowchart?'
628	Psychic	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/psychic.png	You can do a lot better than 1% if you start keeping track of the patterns in what numbers people pick.
629	Skins	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/skins.png	There's Livejournal drama between those who want to wear human suits over fursuits and those who just take off the fursuits.
630	Time Travel	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time_travel.png	She also starts every letter with "Dear Future <your name>".
631	Anatomy Text	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/anatomy_text.png	For many of the anatomy pictures on Wikipedia, I think this is actually not far from reality. They only look all formal and professional due to careful cropping.
632	Suspicion	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/suspicion.png	Fine, walk away.  I'm gonna go cry into a pint of Ben&Jerry's Brownie Batter(tm) ice cream [link], then take out my frustration on a variety of great flash games from PopCap Games(r) [link].
633	Blockbuster Mining	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/blockbuster_mining.png	The 2007 Bridge to Terebithia trailer put me off too much to see that particular movie, but I am cautiously optimistic about Where the Wild Things Are.
634	Date	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/date.png	Well, the kid's definitely getting the biology geek phenotype.
635	Locke and Demosthenes	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/locke_and_demosthenes.png	Dear Peter Wiggin: This letter is to inform you that you have received enough upvotes on your reddit comments to become president of the world.  Please be at the UN tomorrow at 8:00 sharp.
636	Brontosaurus	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/brontosaurus.png	Well, sex is like a velociraptor: despite your movie-fueled lifelong neurotic obsession, unlikely to be found in your house.
637	Scribblenauts	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/scribblenauts.png	Let me look away and type 'guy who's just jealous that I beat all his MarioKart times' and turn back, and ... yup, there you are again!
638	The Search	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_search.png	I am so excited about the Kepler mission. This is the second most important thing our species has ever done, right behind inventing the concept of delivery pizza.
639	Lincoln-Douglas	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lincoln_douglas.png	Stephen Douglas actually died soon after the debates and election, but if you demand historical accuracy in your webcomics you should be reading Hark! A Vagrant.
640	Tornado Hunter	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tornado_hunter.png	The Fujita Scale was replaced by the Enhanced Fujita Scale in 2007, but I think 'EF-5' sounds stupid, so I vote we just use the new measurements for assigning numbers but still call them 'F-whatever'.
641	Free	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free.png	Asbestos is bad; definitely get the one on the right. Wait -- this one over here has no swine flu!  Now I can't decide.
642	Creepy	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/creepy.png	And I even got out my adorable new netbook!
643	Ohm	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ohm.png	More generally, with great power comes great dEnergy/dt.
644	Surgery	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/surgery.png	Damn. Not only did he not install it, he sutured a 'Vista-Ready' sticker onto my arm.
645	RPS	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rps.png	It looks good, but it needs more postfixins.
646	Conversations	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/conversations.png	If the dysentery graph looks historically inaccurate it's because I got all my data from Oregon Trail.
647	Scary	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/scary.png	I'm teaching every 8-year-old relative to say this, and every 14-year-old to do the same thing with Toy Story.  Also, Pokemon hit the US over a decade ago and kids born after Aladdin came out will turn 18 next year.
648	Fall Foliage	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fall_foliage.png	And I could replace you with older pictures of you, from back when you looked happy.
649	Static	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/static.png	I firmly believe that nothing can go wrong on a project if you're wearing one of those wrist things.
650	Nowhere	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nowhere.png	I mean, seriously, NOWHERE? For starters, there are like a thousand species of dinosaur.
651	Bag Check	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/bag_check.png	A laptop battery contains roughly the stored energy of a hand grenade, and if shorted it ... hey!  You can't arrest me if I prove your rules inconsistent!
652	More Accurate	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/more_accurate.png	We live in a world where there are actual fleets of robot assassins patrolling the skies. At some point there, we left the present and entered the future.
653	So Bad It's Worse	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/so_bad_its_worse.png	You think it's so legendarily bad that you'll torrent it and sit through it just for the kitschy nerd cred. I, too, once thought as you did.
654	Nachos	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nachos.png	'Cheater!' 'Hey, gaming on wifi? You have only yourself to blame.'
655	Climbing	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/climbing.png	Where did you even get this wall? Return it there and stand it back up right now.
656	October 30th	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/october_30th.png	Not enough houses on your block?  Just hit them at 30-year intervals from here to 2300 and get 10x the candy.
657	Movie Narrative Charts	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/movie_narrative_charts.png	In the LotR map, up and down correspond LOOSELY to northwest and southeast respectively.
658	Orbitals	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/orbitals.png	Except the people filtering in late are the partiers, so you end up with drunken makeouts in the living room and the next roommate to return home has to sleep in the hall lounge orbital.
659	Lego	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lego.png	Dad, where is Grandpa right now?
660	Sympathy	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sympathy.png	Excellent recovery: ... which we could try to use to somehow save your original brother!
661	Two-Party System	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/two_party_system.png	I favor approval voting or IRV chiefly because they mean we might get to bring back The Bull Moose party.
662	iPhone or Droid	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iphone_or_droid.png	It may be a fundamentally empty experience, but holy crap the Droid's 265 ppi screen is amazing.
663	Sagan-Man	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sagan-man.png	They laugh now, but within 10 years the city's entire criminal class will have quit to work on space research.

668	Pandora	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pandora.png	What?  Oh, no, the 'Enchanted' soundtrack was just playing because Pandora's algorithms are terrible.  [silence] ... (quietly) That's how you knooooooow ...

693	Children's Fantasy	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/childrens_fantasy.png	I was going to be a scientist, but that seems silly now. Magical worlds exist. I've learned a huge truth about our place in the universe. I'm supposed to care about college? I mean, FUCK.

704	Principle of Explosion	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/principle_of_explosion.png	You want me to pick up waffle cones? Oh, right, for the wine. One sec, let me just derive your son's credit card number and I'll be on my way.
705	Devotion to Duty	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/devotion_to_duty.png	The weird sense of duty really good sysadmins have can border on the sociopathic, but it's nice to know that it stands between the forces of darkness and your cat blog's servers.

718	The Flake Equation	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_flake_equation.png	Statistics suggest that there should be tons of alien encounter stories, and in practice there are tons of alien encounter stories. This is known as Fermi's Lack-of-a-Paradox.

731	Desert Island	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/desert_island.png	Telescopes and bathyscaphes and sonar probes of Scottish lakes, Tacoma Narrows bridge collapse explained with abstract phase-space maps, some x-ray slides, a music score, Minard's Napoleonic war: the most exciting new frontier is charting what's already here.
732	HDTV	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/hdtv.png	We're also stuck with blurry, juddery, slow-panning 24fps movies forever because (thanks to 60fps home video) people associate high framerates with camcorders and cheap sitcoms, and thus think good framerates look 'fake'.
733	Eagle	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/eagle.png	In the off-seasons, I hire an animal trainer to help confront secret agents with situations which they are unable to report by radio.
734	Outbreak	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/outbreak.png	Let's get dinner after we promptly destroy all the X-7 we've manufactured.

738	Incision	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/incision.png	At one point, by force of childhood habit, the doctor accidentally removed three or four organs.
739	Malamanteau	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/malamanteau.png	The article has twenty-three citations, one of which is an obscure manuscript from the 1490's and the other twenty-two are arguments on LanguageLog.
740	The Tell-Tale Beat	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_tell_tale_beat.png	You fancy me mad. Could a madman have outsmarted the greatest electronica/techno artists of our era? Next to fall will be Roderick Usher's house/trance band.
741	Blogging	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/blogging.png	I'm looking to virally monetize your eyeballs by selling them for transplants.
742	Campfire	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/campfire.png	100 years later, this story remains terrifying--not because it's the local network block, but because the killer is still on IPv4.
743	Infrastructures	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/infrastructures.png	The heartfelt tune it plays is CC licensed, and you can get it from my seed on JoinDiaspora.com whenever that project gets going.
744	Walkthrough	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/walkthrough.png	There's nothing hotter than porn dubbed over with a poorly-mic'd teenager's voice explaining each step in a droning monotone. 'okay, we're almost at the spawn point ... separate the labia, but watch out, there are more inside them ..."
745	Dyslexics	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dyslexics.png	And of course I had to redo this like three times because I kept writing 'UNTIE'; I kept doing 'doing 'doing it wrong' wrong' wrong.

747	Geeks and Nerds	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/geeks_and_nerds.png	The definitions I grew up with were that a geek is someone unusually into something (so you could have computer geeks, baseball geeks, theater geeks, etc) and nerds are (often awkward) science, math, or computer geeks. But definitions vary.
748	Worst-Case Scenario	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/worst_case_scenario.png	To get serious analyses of hurricanes and oil slicks, see Jeff Masters' blog. To get serious discussions of worst-case scenario thinking, see Bruce Schneier's blog. To get enough Vitamin D, don't read any blogs and go outside instead.

751	Swimsuit Issue	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/swimsuit_issue.png	Parents: talk to your kids about popup blockers. Also, at some point, sex. But crucial fundamentals first!
752	Phobia	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/phobia.png	Oh God, the tornado picked up snakes!
753	Southern Half	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/southern_half.png	Also, if you read his speech at Rice, all his arguments for going to the moon work equally well as arguments for blowing up the moon, sending cloned dinosaurs into space, or constructing a towering penis-shaped obelisk on Mars.
754	Dependencies	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependencies.png	The prereqs for CPSC 357, the class on package management, are CPSC 432, CPSC 357, and glibc2.5 or later.
755	Interdisciplinary	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/interdisciplinary.png	Replace the pendulums with history students and you'll qualify for a grant!
756	Public Opinion	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/public_opinion.png	News networks giving a greater voice to viewers because the social web is so popular are like a chef on the Titanic who, seeing the looming iceberg and fleeing customers, figures ice is the future and starts making snow cones.

759	3x9	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/3x9.png	Handy exam trick: when you know the answer but not the correct derivation, derive blindly forward from the givens and backward from the answer, and join the chains once the equations start looking similar. Sometimes the graders don't notice the seam.
760	Moria	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/moria.png	Someone should really bring them a ladder and remind them to build the Endless Stair *first* next time.
761	DFS	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dfs.png	A breadth-first search makes a lot of sense for dating in general, actually; it suggests dating a bunch of people casually before getting serious, rather than having a series of five-year relationships one after the other.
762	Analogies	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/analogies.png	I just call all of them 'synecdoche'.
763	Workaround	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workaround.png	I once worked on a friend's dad's computer. He had the hard drive divided into six partitions, C: through J:, with a 'Documents' directory tree on each one. Each new file appeared to be saved to a partition at random. I knew enough not to ask.
764	One Two	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/one_two.png	Cue letters from anthropology majors complaining that this view of numerolinguistic development perpetuates a widespread myth. They get to write letters like that because when you're not getting a real science degree you have a lot of free time. Zing!
765	Dilution	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dilution.png	Dear editors of Homeopathy Monthly: I have two small corrections for your July issue.  One, it's spelled "echinacea", and two, homeopathic medicines are no better than placebos and your entire magazine is a sham.
766	Green Flash	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/green_flash.png	The exact cause of the phenomenon is unknown, but it's thought to be linked to atmospheric refraction and you getting a really cool car.
767	Temper	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/temper.png	Mr. Rogers projected an air of genuine, unwavering, almost saintly pure-hearted decency. But when you look deeper, at the person behind the image ... that's exactly what you find there, too. He's exactly what he appears to be.
768	1996	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/1996.png	College Board issues aside, I have fond memories of TI-BASIC, writing in it a 3D graphing engine and a stock market analyzer. With enough patience, I could make anything ... but friends. (Although with my chatterbot experiments, I certainly tried.)
769	War	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/war.png	They offered to make me a green beret, but I liked my regular one. Although it gets kind of squashed under my helmet.
770	All the Girls	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/all_the_girls.png	You know that I'll never leave you. Not as long as she's with someone.
771	Period Speech	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/period_speech.png	The same people who spend their weekends at the Blogger Reenactment Festivals will whine about the anachronisms in historical movies, but no one else will care.

773	University Website	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/university_website.png	People go to the website because they can't wait for the next alumni magazine, right? What do you mean, you want a campus map? One of our students made one as a CS class project back in '01!  You can click to zoom and everything!
774	Atheists	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/atheists.png	'But you're using that same tactic to try to feel superior to me, too!' 'Sorry, that accusation expires after one use per conversation.'
775	Savannah Ancestry	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/savannah_ancestry.png	She's a perfectly nice lady from a beautiful city, and there's no reason to be mean just because she thinks a quarterback is a river in Egypt.
776	Still No Sleep	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/still_no_sleep.png	I'm not listening to you.  I mean, what does a SQUIRREL know about mental health?
777	Pore Strips	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pore_strips.png	I'm sure they're a harmful tool of the cosmetics-industrial complex and all, but my goodness do those strips ever work to pull gunk out of your pores. I was shocked, disgusted, and vaguely fascinated by the result.
778	Scheduling	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/scheduling.png	'How about a little ... *family growth*?'  'Dude, that's not until round two.'
779	Anxiety	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/anxiety.png	Don't need any, thanks. I have a backscattering fetish.
780	Sample	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sample.png	There are two or three songs out there with beeps in the chorus that sound exactly like the clock radio alarm I had in high school, and hearing it makes me think my life since junior year has been a dream I'm about to wake up from.
781	Ahead Stop	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ahead_stop.png	They actually started the reversed-text practice in 1977 -- not for ease-of-reading reasons, but because too many people were driving backward down the highway blasting the Star Wars opening theme.
782	Desecration	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/desecration.png	It gets worse! You know that wizened old monk with the gypsy wife whose voodoo shop we smash up every day after school?
783	I Don't Want Directions	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/i_dont_want_directions.png	Yes, I understand that the turn is half a mile past the big field, but my GPS knows that, too.  This would be easier if you weren't about to ask me to repeat it all back to you.
784	Falling Asleep	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/falling_asleep.png	Sweet unintersecting dreams!
785	Open Mic Night	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/open_mic_night.png	Ever notice how the more successful observational comics become, the more their jokes focus on flying and hotels?

787	Orbiter	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/orbiter.png	Normally, the Shuttle can't quite safely reach the orbital inclination required to pass over both those points from a Canaveral launch, but this is an alternate history in which either it launches from Vandenberg or everyone hates the Outer Banks.
788	The Carriage	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_carriage.png	I learned from Achewood that since this poem is in ballad meter, it can be sung to the tune of Gilligan's Island.  Since then, try as I might, I haven't ONCE been able to read it normally.
789	Showdown	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/showdown.png	The tumbleweed then tried to roll off into the sunset, but due to the Old West's placement north of the subtropical ridge, the prevailing winds were in the wrong direction.

791	Leaving	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/leaving.png	What'll I say -- "I was staring at some cat vomit when I got the news?"
792	Password Reuse	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_reuse.png	It'll be hilarious the first few times this happens.
793	Physicists	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/physicists.png	If you need some help with the math, let me know, but that should be enough to get you started! Huh? No, I don't need to read your thesis, I can imagine roughly what it says.
794	Inside Joke	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/inside_joke.png	I've looked through a few annotated versions of classic books, and it's shocking how much of what's in there is basically pop-culture references totally lost on us now.
795	Conditional Risk	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/conditional_risk.png	'Dude, wait -- I'm not American! So my risk is basically zero!'
796	Bad Ex	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/bad_ex.png	Since the goatee, glasses, and Seltzer & Friedberg DVD collection didn't tip you off, there will be a $20 negligence charge for this service.

The Town is supposed to be good, and I thou--' 'PHYSICIST STEPHEN HAWKING DECLARES NEW FILM BEST IN ALL SPACE AND TIME' 'No, I just heard that--' 'SHOULD SCIENCE PLAY A ROLE IN JUDGING BEN AFFLECK?' 'I don't think--' 'WHAT ABOUT MATT DAMON?'
800	Beautiful Dream	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/beautiful_dream.png	Lucky. In MY dream, all the people who grew up loving The Giving Tree paired up with all the students who had weird dreams after reading The Metamorphosis. That one was more confusing.
801	Golden Hammer	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/golden_hammer.png	Took me five tries to find the right one, but I managed to salvage our night out--if not the boat--in the end.
802	Online Communities 2	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/online_communities_2.png	Best trivia I learned while working on this: 'Man, Farmville is so huge! Do you realize it's the second-biggest browser-based social-networking-centered farming game in the WORLD?' Then you wait for the listener to do a double-take.

They not only corroborated your story, but even said you totally mentioned wanting to start a company someday. Sorry! If this isn't enough money, let us know.
828	Positive Attitude	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/positive_attitude.png	Having a positive attitude is almost tautologically good for your mental health, and extreme stress can hurt your immune system, but that doesn't mean you should feel like shit for feeling like shit.
829	Arsenic-Based Life	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/arsenic_based_life.png	According to a new paper published in the journal Science, reporters are unable to thrive in an arsenic-rich environment.
830	Genetic Analysis	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/genetic_analysis.png	There's still a chance you were conceived via IVF. But we've checked your mom's college yearbook photos, and whether or not she and your father had sex, it's clear that ... listen, I know this is hard for you.
831	Weather Radar	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/weather_radar.png	Ever notice how there aren't as many thunderstorms now as there were when you were a kid?  Much like 'the shuffle on my MP3 player has a bias', this is occasionally true but universally believed. Brains are so interesting!

839	Explorers	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/explorers.png	We're going to have to work together to get over our hangups if we're going to learn to move on Catan's hexagonal grid. It's bad enough that we lost our crew of pawns when we passed within firing range of Battleship.

847	Stingray Nebula	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/stingray_nebula.png	Erendil will patrol the walls of night only until the sun reaches red giant stage, engulfing the Morning Star on his brow. Light and high beauty are passing things as well.

849	Complex Conjugate	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/complex_conjugate.png	Fun fact: if you say this every time a professor does something to a complex-number equation that drops the imaginary part, they'll eventually move the class to another room and tell everyone else except you.
850	World According to Americans	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/world_according_to_americans.png	It's not our fault we caught a group on their way home from a geography bee. And they taught us that Uzbekistan is one of the world's two doubly-landlocked countries!
851	Na	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/na.png	I hear that there are actual lyrics later on in Land of 1,000 Dances, but other than the occasional 'I said,' I've never listened long enough to hear any of them.

854	Learning to Cook	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/learning_to_cook.png	And yet I never stop thinking, 'sure, these ingredients cost more than a restaurant meal, but think how many meals I'll get out of them! Especially since each one will have leftovers!'

861	Wisdom Teeth	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_teeth.png	I heard the general anesthesia drugs can cause amnesia, so when I woke up mid-extraction I started taking notes on my hand so I'd remember things later. I managed 'AWAKE BUT EVERYTHING OK' before the dental assistant managed to find and confiscate all my pens.
862	Let Go	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/let_go.png	After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected.
863	Major in the Universe	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/major_in_the_universe.png	I hear Steven Levitt is writing a book analyzing A.J. Jacobs' quest to spend a year reading everything Malcolm Gladwell ever wrote. The audiobook will be narrated by Robert Krulwich of Radiolab.

865	Nanobots	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nanobots.png	I think the IETF hit the right balance with the 128 bits thing. We can fit MAC addresses in a /64 subnet, and the nanobots will only be able to devour half the planet.
866	Compass and Straightedge	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compass_and_straightedge.png	The Greeks long suspected this, but it wasn't until April 12th of 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann conclusively proved it when he constructed himself the most awesome birthday party possible and nobody showed up.
867	Herpetology	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/herpetology.png	Birds are Aves, which is part of the clade Theropoda, which is in Saurischia, which is in Dinosauria. Those birds outside our windows are dinosaurs. We can clear out the rest of our brains because we now have the best fact.
868	Nolan Chart	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nolan_chart.png	Also in the right quadrant are NFPA-compliant chemical manufacturers and Sir Charles Wheatstone. Sharing the top with the internet libertarians are Nate Silver and several politically-active kite designers.
869	Server Attention Span	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/server_attention_span.png	They have to keep the adjacent rack units empty. Otherwise, half the entries in their /var/log/syslog are just 'SERVER BELOW TRYING TO START CONVERSATION *AGAIN*.' and 'WISH THEY'D STOP GIVING HIM SO MUCH COFFEE IT SPLATTERS EVERYWHERE.'
870	Advertising	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mathematically_annoying.png	I remember the exact moment in my childhood when I realized, while reading a flyer, that nobody would ever spend money solely to tell me they wanted to give me something for nothing. It's a much more vivid memory than the (related) parental Santa talk.
871	Charity	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/charity.png	I usually respond to someone else doing something good by figuring out a reason that they're not really as good as they seem. But I've been realizing lately that there's an easier way to handle these situations, and it involves zero internet arguments.
872	Fairy Tales	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fairy_tales.png	Goldilocks' discovery of Newton's method for approximation required surprisingly few changes.
873	FPS Mod	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fps_mod.png	Wait, that second one is a woman?  ... wait, if that bothers me, then why doesn't ... man, this game is no fun anymore.
874	Time Management	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/time_management.png	I never trust anyone who's more excited about success than about doing the thing they want to be successful at.
875	2009 Called	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/2009_called.png	2017 called, but I couldn't understand what they were saying over all the screams.
876	Trapped	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/trapped.png	Socrates could've saved himself a lot of trouble if he'd just brought a flashlight, tranquilizer gun, and a bunch of rescue harnesses.
877	Beauty	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/beauty.png	The best hugs are probably from hagfish, which can extrude microscopic filaments that convert a huge volume of water around them to slime in seconds. Instant cozy blanket!
878	Model Rail	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/model_rail.png	I don't know what's more telling--the number of pages in the Wikipedia talk page argument over whether the 1/87.0857143 scale is called "HO" or "H0", or the fact that within minutes of first hearing of it I had developed an extremely strong opinion on the issue.
879	Lamp	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lamp.png	'That was definitely not in my top three wishes.' 'Who said anything about YOUR wishes?'
880	Headache	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/headache.png	I'm only willing to visit placid lakes, salt flats, and painting exhibits until the world's 3D technology improves.
881	Probability	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/probability.png	My normal approach is useless here, too.
882	Significant	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/significant.png	'So, uh, we did the green study again and got no link. It was probably a--' 'RESEARCH CONFLICTED ON GREEN JELLY BEAN/ACNE LINK; MORE STUDY RECOMMENDED!'
883	Pain Rating	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pain_rating.png	If it were a two or above I wouldn't be able to answer because it would mean a pause in the screaming.
884	Rogers St.	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rogers_st.png	'We can also use middle names in place of first pet's names, but yours is something incomprehensible about dropping tables.'
885	Recycling	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/recycling.png	And given how much of my stuff they go through, they definitely know where I live.
886	Craigslist Apartments	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/craigslist_apartments.png	$1600 / 1386153BR 3BATH, MODERN SLIDING DOORS, GUEST ROOMS, GARBAGE DISPOSAL. FREE MANDATORY PARKING (ENFORCED). CONVENIENT TO ALDERAAN.

888	Heaven	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heaven.png	If you've never had sex, this is what it feels like. Complete with the brief feeling of satisfaction, followed by ennui, followed by getting bored and trying to make it happen again.
889	Turtles	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/turtles.png	You're a turtle!
890	Etymology	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/etymology.png	For some reason, my childhood suspension of disbelief had no problem with the fact that this ancient galaxy is full of humans, but was derailed by language. There's no Asia OR Europe there, so where'd they get all the Indo-European roots?
891	Movie Ages	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/movie_ages.png	If you're 15 or younger, then just remember that it's nevertheless probably too late to be a child prodigy.
892	Null Hypothesis	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/null_hypothesis.png	Hell, my eighth grade science class managed to conclusively reject it just based on a classroom experiment. It's pretty sad to hear about million-dollar research teams who can't even manage that.
893	65 Years	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/65_years.png	The universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there's no good reason to go into space--each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision.
894	Progeny	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/progeny.png	I tell my children 'it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.' I'm trying to take the edge off their competitive drive to ensure that I can always beat them.
895	Teaching Physics	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/teaching_physics.png	Space-time is like some simple and familiar system which is both intuitively understandable and precisely analogous, and if I were Richard Feynman I'd be able to come up with it.
896	Marie Curie	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/marie_curie.png	Although not permanently.
897	Elevator Inspection	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/elevator_inspection.png	Even governmental elevator inspectors get bored halfway through asking where the building office is.
898	Chain of Command	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/chain_of_command.png	Themistocles said his infant son ruled all Greece -- "Athens rules all Greece; I control Athens; my wife controls me; and my infant son controls her." Thus, nowadays the world is controlled by whoever buys advertising time on Dora the Explorer.
899	Number Line	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/number_line.png	The Wikipedia page "List of Numbers" opens with "This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it."

902	Darmok and Jalad	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/darmok_and_jalad.png	I wonder how often Patrick Stewart has Darmok flashbacks when talking to Star Trek fans.
903	Extended Mind	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/extended_mind.png	Wikipedia trivia: if you take any article, click on the first link in the article text not in parentheses or italics, and then repeat, you will eventually end up at "Philosophy".
904	Sports	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sports.png	Also, all financial analysis. And, more directly, D&D.
905	Homeownership	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/homeownership.png	New research shows over 60% of the financial collapse's toxic assets were created by power drills.
906	Advertising Discovery	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/citations.png	When advertisers figure this out, our only weapon will be blue sharpies and "[disputed]".
907	Ages	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ages.png	Every age: "I'm glad I'm not the clueless person I was five years ago, but now I don't want to get any older."
908	The Cloud	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_cloud.png	There's planned downtime every night when we turn on the Roomba and it runs over the cord.
909	Worst-Case Shopping	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/worst_case_shopping.png	Wait a minute. If I'm escaping from a submarine at 50 meters, then I'll *definitely* need a flashlight to find air pockets for gradual decompression on the way up. Time to start shopping professional dive lights.
910	Permanence	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/permanence.png	This hostname is going in dozens of remote config files. Changing a kid's name is comparatively easy!
911	Magic School Bus	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/magic_school_bus.png	At my OLD school, we used Microsoft Encarta 2005.
912	Manual Override	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/manual_override.png	I think you mean 'GNU Info Override'.
913	Core	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/core.png	If you're a geologist or geophysicist and you don't introduce yourself by saying your name, then gesturing downward and saying "... and I study that", I don't know what you're doing with your life.
914	Ice	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ice.png	On the plus side, she wrote 'Welcome to the AAA Club!' in lipstick on the bathroom mirror, and left me a membership/roadside assistance card on the counter.

918	Google+	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/googleplus.png	On one hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch. On the other hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch!
919	Tween Bromance	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tween_bromance.png	Verbiage. Va-jay-jay. Irregardless.
920	YouTube Parties	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube_parties.png	This reminds me of that video where ... no? How have you not seen that? Oh man, let me find it. No, it's ok, we can go back to your video later.

927	Standards	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png	Fortunately, the charging one has been solved now that we've all standardized on mini-USB. Or is it micro-USB? Shit.
928	Mimic Octopus	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mimic_octopus.png	Even if the dictionaries are starting to give in, I refuse to accept 'octopi' as a word mainly because--I'm not making this up--there's a really satisfying climactic scene in the Orson Scott Card horror novel 'Lost Boys' which hinges on it being an incorrect pluralization.
929	Speculation	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/speculation.png	'I was pretty good at skeet shooting, but was eventually kicked off the range for catching the clay pigeons in a net and dispatching them execution-style.'

934	Mac/PC	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mac_pc.png	It's fun to watch browsers fumblingly recapitulate the history of window management. Someday we'll have xmonad as a Firefox extension.

947	Investing	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/investing.png	But Einstein said it was the most powerful force in the universe, and I take all my investment advice from flippant remarks by theoretical physicists making small talk at parties.

955	Neutrinos	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/neutrinos.png	I can't speak to the paper's scientific merits, but it's really cool how on page 10 you can see that their reference GPS beacon is sensitive enough to pick up continential drift under the detector (interrupted halfway through by an earthquake).

965	Elements	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/elements.png	Of all the nations, the armies of the ununoctium-benders are probably the least intimidating. The xenon-benders come close, but their flickery signs are at least effective for propaganda.

978	Citogenesis	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/citogenesis.png	I just read a pop-science book by a respected author.

He has been endorsed by Tracy Morgan, John Wilkes Booth's ghost, and the Time Cube guy.
986	Drinking Fountains	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/drinking_fountains.png	I've always wondered whether you could drink slowly enough, and eliminate fast enough, that you just sort of peed continuously.

994	Advent Calendar	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/advent_calendar.png	I think you could get up to about 11:59:57 before you'd have trouble swallowing the chocolates fast enough. At that point, you'd need some kind of a liquify-and-chug apparatus to get up over the 11:59:59 barrier. Anyway, Merry Christmas!

1069	Alphabet	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/alphabet.png	Do I get to remove letters entirely? Or just rearrange them? Because the 'k/c' situation is ridiculous. Look, we can make out whenever. This is *immortality*!
1070	Words for Small Sets	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/words_for_small_sets.png	If things are too quiet, try asking a couple of friends whether "a couple" should always mean "two".

1072	Seventies	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/seventies.png	Hey, man, the 1670s called. They were like 'Wherefore this demonic intrument? By what orcery does it produce uch ounds?"
1073	Weekend	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/weekend.png	Of the two Garfields, you wouldn't think the cat would turn out to be the more compelling presidential speechwriter, but there you go.
1074	Moon Landing	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/moon_landing.png	Ok, so Spirit and Opportunity are pretty awesome. And Kepler. And New Horizons, Cassini, Curiosity, TiME, and Project M. But c'mon, if the Earth were a basketball, in 40 years no human's been more than half an inch from the surface.
1075	Warning	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/warning.png	Also possibly several miles beyond that.
1076	Groundhog Day	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/groundhog_day.png	If you closely examine the cosmic background radiation, you can pick up lingering echoes of 'I Got You Babe'.

1080	Visual Field	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/visual_field.png	I recently learned something that solved a mystery that had bugged me since childhood--why, when I looked at an analog clock, the hand would sometimes seem to take a couple seconds to start ticking. Google "stopped clock illusion".
1081	Argument Victory	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/argument_victory.png	Really, the comforting side in most conspiracy theory arguments is the one claiming that anyone who's in power has any plan at all.
1082	Geology	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/geology.png	That's a gneiss butte.
1083	Writing Styles	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/writing_styles.png	I liked the idea, suggested by h00k on bash.org, of a Twitter bot that messages prominent politicians to tell them when they've unnecessarily used sms-speak abbreviations despite having plenty of characters left.
1084	Server Problem	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/server_problem.png	Protip: Annoy Ray Kurzweil by always referring to it as the 'Cybersingularity'.
1085	ContextBot	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/contextbot.png	If you read all vaguebooking/vaguetweeting with the assumption that they're saying everything they can without revealing classified military information, the internet gets way more exciting.
1086	Eyelash Wish Log	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/eyelash_wish_log.png	Ooh, another one. Uh ... the ability to alter any coefficients of friction at will during sporting events.
1087	Cirith Ungol	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cirith_ungol.png	My all-time favorite example of syntactic ambiguity comes from Wikipedia: 'Charlotte's Web is a children's novel by American author E. B. White, about a pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by an intelligent spider named Charlotte.'
1088	Five Years	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/five_years.png	'Well, no further questions. You're hired!' 'Oh, sorry! I'm no longer interested. There's a bunch of future I gotta go check out!'
1089	Internal Monologue	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/internal_monologue.png	Oh right, eye contact. Ok, good, holding the eye contact ... holding ... still holding ... ok, too long! Getting weird! Quick, look thoughtfully into space and nod. Oh, dammit, said 'yeah' again!
1090	Formal Languages	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/formal_languages.png	[audience looks around] 'What just happened?' 'There must be some context we're missing.'
1091	Curiosity	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/curiosity.png	As of this writing the NASA/JPL websites are still overloaded. Trying CURIOSITY-REAR-CAM_[256px_x_256px].torrent.SwEsUb.DVDRip.XviD-aXXo.jpg instead.
1092	Michael Phelps	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/michael_phelps.png	[shortly] ... he ate ALL of it!?
1093	Forget	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/forget.png	'Baby Got Back' turned 20 this year. My favorite nostalgia show is VH1's 'I Love The Inexorable March of Time Toward the Grave That Awaits Us All.'
1094	Interview	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/interview.png	Hey, before you go, can you explain to me what job I now have?
1095	Crazy Straws	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/crazy_straws.png	The new crowd is heavily shaped by this guy named Eric, who's basically the Paris Hilton of the amateur plastic crazy straw design world.
1096	Clinically Studied Ingredient	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/clinically_studied_ingredient.png	Blatantly banking on customers not understanding that it's like a Hollywood studio advertising that their new movie was 'watched by Roger Ebert'.
1097	A Hypochondriac's Nightmare	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/a_hypochondriacs_nightmare.png	BUT WHAT IF I REASSURE MYSELF WITH A JOKE AND THEN DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE RASH AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE DEATH MITES AND I COULD HAVE CAUGHT IT
1098	Star Ratings	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/star_ratings.png	I got lost and wandered into the world's creepiest cemetery, where the headstones just had names and star ratings. Freaked me out. When I got home I tried to leave the cemetery a bad review on Yelp, but as my hand hovered over the 'one star' button I felt this distant chill ...
1099	Tuesdays	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tuesdays.png	Try our bottomless drinks and fall forever!
1100	Vows	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/vows.png	So, um. Do you want to get a drink after the game?

1102	Fastest-Growing	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fastest_growing.png	I lead a small but extraordinarily persuasive religion whose only members are door-to-door proselytizers from other faiths.
1103	Nine	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nine.png	FYI: If you get curious and start trying to calculate the time adjustment function that minimizes the gap between the most-used and least-used digit (for a representative sample of common cook times) without altering any time by more than 10%, and someone asks you what you're doing, it's easier to just lie.
1104	Feathers	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/feathers.png	Click to see a video of a modern bird using stability flapping during predatory behavior. It all fits! Also, apparently Microraptor had *four* wings? The past keeps getting cooler! (And there's more of it every day!)
1105	License Plate	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/license_plate.png	The next day: 'What? Six bank robberies!? But I just vandalized the library!' 'Nice try. They saw your plate with all the 1's and I's.' 'That's impossible! I've been with my car the whole ti-- ... wait. Ok, wow, that was clever of her.'
1106	ADD	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/add.png	20 balloons float away while I'm busy permanently tying one to a tree to deal with it for good. Unfortunately, that one balloon was 'land a rocket on the moon in Kerbal Space Program.'
1107	Sports Cheat Sheet	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sports_cheat_sheet.png	I would subscribe to a Twitter feed that supplied you with one reasonable sports opinion per day, like 'The Red Sox can't make the playoffs (championship games), but in last night's game their win seriously damaged the chances of the Yankees (longstanding rival team).'
1108	Cautionary Ghost	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cautionary_ghost.png	But then the Ghost of Subjunctive Past showed up and told me to stay strong on 'if it were'.
1109	Refrigerator	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/refrigerator.png	I want this engraved on my tombstone like the Epitaph of Stevinus.
1110	Click and Drag	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/click_and_drag.png	Click and drag.
1111	Premiere	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/premiere.png	'But what's the buzz about the film?' 'We're hoping it's distracting.'
1112	Think Logically	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/think_logically.png	I've developed a more logical set of rules but the people on the chess community have a bunch of stupid emotional biases and won't reply to my posts.
1113	Killed In Action	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/killed_in_action.png	We can't let this happen again. We need to build a secure TWO-day-before-retirement safe room.
1114	Metallurgy	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/metallurgy.png	This exotic blade was wrought from a different fallen star. The meteorite was a carbonaceous chondrite, so it's basically a lump of gravel glued into the shape of a sword. A SPACE sword!
1115	Sky	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sky.png	I dropped a bird and I didn't hear it hit bottom.
1116	Traffic Lights	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/traffic_lights.gif	There's an intersection I drive through sometimes that has a forward green arrow, a red light, and a 'no turns' sign all on one pole. I honestly have no idea what it's telling me to do.
1117	My Sky	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/my_sky.png	According to my mom, my first word was (looking up at the sky) 'Wow!'
1118	Microsoft	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/microsoft.png	Facebook, Apple, and Google all got away with their monopolist power grabs because they don't have any 'S's in their names for critics to snarkily replace with '$'s.
1119	Undoing	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/undoing.png	I've been sneaking out at night and installing lamps on the underside of every photovoltaic panel I can find. Sure, there are upwards of 80% losses, but I prefer to think of them as nearly 20% gains.
1120	Blurring the Line	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/blurring_the_line.png	People into masturbatory navel-gazing have a lot to learn about masturbation.
1121	Identity	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/identity.png	Not sure why I just taught everyone to flawlessly impersonate me to pretty much anyone I know. Just remember to constantly bring up how cool it is that birds are dinosaurs and you'll be set.
1122	Electoral Precedent	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/electoral_precedent.png	No white guy who's been mentioned on Twitter has gone on to win.
1123	The Universal Label	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_universal_label.png	Works for any grocery or non-grocery. Even thyme is just H and time.
1124	Law of Drama	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/law_of_drama.png	'Drama' is just 'people being upset', when someone says they're always surrounded by drama and they just ignore it, it starts to make sense that their strategy might be backfiring.
1125	Objects In Mirror	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/objects_in_mirror.png	Universes in mirror, like those in windshield, are larger than they appear.
1126	Epsilon and Zeta	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/epsilon_and_zeta.png	The average error in the NHC forecasted position of a hurricane three days in the future has shrunk to a third of what it was in 1990--a staggering accomplishment. However, as you may have gathered, forecasts of future storm *strength* have proved more difficult to improve.
1127	Congress	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/congress.png	It'd be great if some news network started featuring partisan hack talking heads who were all Federalists and Jacksonians, just to see how long it took us to catch on.
1128	Fifty Shades	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fifty_shades.png	Wishbone and the Illustrated Classics series have gotten me through every conversation I've ever had about Dickens, Treasure Island, The Anarchist's Cookbook, and Our Bodies, Ourselves.
1129	Cell Number	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cell_number.png	There's also a +1 sometimes, which is there to keep everyone on their toes. In the future, people who got to pick cool numbers by signing up for Google Voice early will be revered as wizards.
1130	Poll Watching	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/poll_watching.png	The choices we make Tuesday could have MASSIVE and PERMANENT effects on the charts on Nate Silver's blog!
1131	Math	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/math.png	As of this writing, the only thing that's 'razor-thin' or 'too close to call' is the gap between the consensus poll forecast and the result.
1132	Frequentists vs. Bayesians	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/frequentists_vs_bayesians.png	'Detector! What would the Bayesian statistician say if I asked him whether the--' [roll] 'I AM A NEUTRINO DETECTOR, NOT A LABYRINTH GUARD. SERIOUSLY, DID YOUR BRAIN FALL OUT?' [roll] '... yes.'
1133	Up Goer Five	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/up_goer_five.png	Another thing that is a bad problem is if you're flying toward space and the parts start to fall off your space car in the wrong order. If that happens, it means you won't go to space today, or maybe ever.
1134	Logic Boat	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/logic_boat.png	Or a cabbage, for that matter. The goat makes sense. Goats are fine.
1135	Arachnoneurology	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/arachnoneurology.png	SPIDER PSYCHOLOGY (21st Ed.) is a comprehensive overview of arachnoneurology, neuro-arachnology, forensic arachnology, neuro-arachnoneurology (the study of the brains of spider neurology experts), and arachnoarachnology (the study of too many spiders).
1136	Broken Mirror	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/broken_mirror.png	'I see you're in this mood again.' 'I am always in this mood.'
1137	\u202eLTR	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rtl.png	Collaborative editing can quickly become a textual rap battle fought with increasingly convoluted invocations of U+202a to U+202e.
1138	Heatmap	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heatmap.png	There are also a lot of global versions of this map showing traffic to English-language websites which are indistinguishable from maps of the location of internet users who are native English speakers.
1139	Rubber and Glue	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rubber_and_glue.png	I'm rubber. You're rubber. We contemplate the reality of our existence in mute, vulcanized horror.
1140	Calendar of Meaningful Dates	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/calendar_of_meaningful_dates.png	In months other than September, the 11th is mentioned substantially less often than any other date. It's been that way since long before 9/11 and I have no idea why.
1141	Two Years	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/two_years.png	She won the first half of all our chemo Scrabble games, but then her IV drugs started kicking in and I *dominated*.
1142	Coverage	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/coverage.png	My resonant tunneling diode phone has limited range but a short enough wavelength to penetrate even the densest cages. This gives me a major combat advantage, hopefully.
1143	Location	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/location.png	Ingress: Foursquare With Space Noises.
1144	Tags	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tags.png	<A>: Like </a>this.&nbsp;
1145	Sky Color	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sky_color.png	Feynman recounted another good one upperclassmen would use on freshmen physics students: When you look at words in a mirror, how come they're reversed left to right but not top to bottom? What's special about the horizontal axis?
1146	Honest	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/honest.png	I didn't understand what you meant. I still don't. But I'll figure it out soon!
1147	Evolving	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/evolving.png	Biologists play reverse Pokmon, trying to avoid putting any one team member on the front lines long enough for the experience to cause evolution.
1148	Nothing to Offer	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nothing_to_offer.png	cerebrospinal fluid, pericardial fluid, sputum, aqueous humor, perilymph, chyme, hydatid fluid, interstitial fluid, rheum, and gin.
1149	Broomstick	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/broomstick.png	'Broom first, then slippers.' 'How do I know you'll return the broom once you've secured your ticket?' 'I'll leave my little dog as collateral.' 'Great. Pleasure doing business!'
1150	Instagram	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/instagram.png	I'm gonna call the cops and get Chad arrested for theft, then move all my stuff to the house across the street. Hopefully the owners there are more responsible.
1151	Tests	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tests.png	In fact, one of the boxes is full of Staphylococcus. The wrapping paper is coated in E. coli, though, so it's an understandable mistake. You know, we should really stop accepting gifts from that guy.
1152	Communion	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/communion.png	The local police, growing increasingly concerned about this church, ask parishioners to take a sip of wine and then spit it back out for DNA testing. It's blood, and it matches a 1970s murder victim.
1153	Proof	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/proof.png	The prosecution calls Gottfried Leibniz.
1154	Resolution	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/resolution.png	If at first you don't succeed, that's one data point.
1155	Kolmogorov Directions	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/kolmogorov_directions.png	People get really grumpy when they realize you're giving them directions for how to go to the store and buy a GPS.
1156	Conditioning	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/conditioning.png	'Why are you standing in the yard wearing a papal hat and a robe covered in seeds?' 'Well, the Pope is visiting our town next month ...'
1157	Sick Day	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sick_day.png	Wikipedia path: Virus -> Immune system -> Innate immune system -> Parasites -> List of parasites of humans -> Naegleria fowleri -> Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis -> Deciding I DEFINITELY shouldn't connect an aquarium pump to my sinuses
1158	Rubber Sheet	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rubber_sheet.png	It IS about physics. It ALL is.
1159	Countdown	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/countdown.png	For all we know, the odds are in our favor.
1160	Drop Those Pounds	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/drop_those_pounds.png	If the flyers don't work, we'll switch to the LEAST subtle method of informing a town of the existence of a trebuchet club.
1161	Hand Sanitizer	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/hand_sanitizer.png	Hipster CDC Reports Flu Epidemic Peaked Years Ago
1162	Log Scale	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/log_scale.png	Knuth Paper-Stack Notation: Write down the number on pages. Stack them. If the stack is too tall to fit in the room, write down the number of pages it would take to write down the number. THAT number won't fit in the room? Repeat. When a stack fits, write the number of iterations on a card. Pin it to the stack.
1163	Debugger	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/debugger.png	It can take a site a while to figure out that there's a problem with their 'report a bug' form.
1164	Home Alone	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/home_alone.png	Starring Macaulay Culkin.
1165	Amazon	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/amazon.png	Amazon.com took a surprise early lead with 'Time required to transport a package from Iquitos, Peru to Manaus, Brazil' but then lost it at 'Minutes to skeletonize a cow'.
1166	Argument	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/argument.png	The misguided search for a perpetual motion machine has run substantially longer than any attempted perpetual motion machine.
1167	Star Trek into Darkness	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/star_trek_into_darkness.png	Of course, factions immediately sprang up in favor of '~*~sTaR tReK iNtO dArKnEsS~*~', 'xX_StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNess_Xx', and 'Star Trek lnto Darkness' (that's a lowercase 'L').
1168	tar	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png	I don't know what's worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can't keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I'm still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started.
1169	Expedition	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/expedition.png	I'm pretty sure I've logged more hours in Google Maps over the past decade than in any game.
